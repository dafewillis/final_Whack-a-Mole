This is my final Whack-a-Mole project.

You can see it in action here: https://confident-panini-6c3fec.netlify.app/

I had problems with git bash tonight so had to use the github interface to create this repo.
I'll reach out next week to figure out what I did wrong with git bash.

I didn't use states for whack-a-mole, but learned a lot anyway.
